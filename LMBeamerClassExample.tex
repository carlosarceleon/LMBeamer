\section{Text} 
\frame{\frametitle{Regular text}

}

\section{Lists} 
\frame{
\frametitle{Bulleted lists}
Use the {\tt itemize} environment to create itemized lists:
\begin{itemize}
\item Item 1
  \begin{itemize}
	 \item Subitem 1
  \end{itemize}
\item Item 2
  \begin{itemize}
	 \item Subitem 1
	 \item Subitem 2
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize} 
Later it will be seen how to uncover these piecewise: 
\hyperlink{piecewise}{\beamerbutton{Piecewise uncovering}}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Enumerated lists}
Enumerated lists can be created with \LaTeX's usual {\tt enumerate} environment and will look like this:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Item 1
  \begin{enumerate}
	 \item Subitem 1
  \end{enumerate}
\item Item 2
  \begin{enumerate}
	 \item Subitem 1
	 \item Subitem 2
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate} 
}

\frame{
Use the {\tt description} environment to list descriptions. Unfortunately it looks like these should be quite short to keep the alignment tamed.
\frametitle{Description lists}
\begin{description}
  \item[$1^{\text{st}}$ item] its description
  \item[$2^{\text{nd}}$ item] second's description
  \item[$3^{\text{rd}}$ item] and so forth...
\end{description}
}

\section{Text effects} 
\frame{\frametitle{Alerted text}
This text is normal, while \alert{this is alerted}.
}

\begin{frame}[label=piecewise]
\frametitle{Piecewise uncovering of items}
Piecewise uncovering can be used. In this case alerted text is used for the current item with the command {\tt \\item<X-| alert@1>} where {\tt X} is the slide number it should appear on.
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-| alert@1> First point.
\item<2-| alert@2> Second point.
\item<3-| alert@3> Third point.
\end{itemize}
\vfill
\uncover<4->{
A transparency of 40\% is by default applied to uncovered items and can be modified by using the command {\tt \\setbeamercovered\{transparent=XX\}}
}

\end{frame}


\section{Blocks}
\frame{\frametitle{Blocs}

\begin{block}{Title of the bloc}
bloc text
\end{block}

\begin{exampleblock}{Title of ``example'' bloc}
bloc text
\end{exampleblock}


\begin{alertblock}{Title of ``alerted'' bloc}
bloc text
\end{alertblock}
}

\section{Floats}
\subsection{Equations}
\frame{
\frametitle{Equations}
Equations can be typeset using the regular \LaTeX commands\invisible<1>{, but of course can contain overlays:}
\begin{equation}
  \rho\left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}+ \alert<2->{\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}} \right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}
  \label{ns}
\end{equation}
}

\subsection{Figures}
\frame{
\frametitle{Figures}
Figures can be included using the {\tt figure} environment and the {\\includegraphics} command (in case of using a PNG image)
\vspace{1cm}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
	 \includegraphics[width=0.5\paperheight]{LMBlades.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{This is LM's logo, for example}
  \label{fig:LM}
\end{figure}
}

\subsection{Tables}
\frame{\frametitle{Tables}
The default format used for tables by the LM template in PowerPoint sets the header row as dark blue, then the rest of rows as alternating between the LM gray at 25\% and white. Since the purpose of tables is too broad, this format will not be generalized in this Beamer class.

None the less, by using the command {\tt \char`\\rowcolors\{X\}\{COLOR1\}\{COLOR2\}} one can produce a table that starts coloring in row {\tt X} with {\tt COLOR1} in the even rows and {\tt COLOR2} in the uneven rows.

%This command sets interchanging colors between the table rows, much like
%LM's PowerPoint template, yet the first column must be specified independently
\rowcolors{2}{white}{LMGray25}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
  \rowcolor{LMBlue}
  & \bf C1 & \bf C2 & \bf C3 & \bf C4\\ 
R1& A & B & C & D\\ 
R2& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\  
R3& A & B & C & D\\ 
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
}


%These colors are predefined in the LM Beamer class; use them freely
\section{Colors}
\frame{
\frametitle{Predefined colors}
The following colors have been predefined:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{LMBlue}{LMBlue}
  \item \textcolor{LMGray}{LMGray}
  \item \textcolor{LMGray75}{LMGray75}
  \item \textcolor{LMGray50}{LMGray50}
  \item \textcolor{LMGray25}{LMGray25}
  \item \textcolor{LMLightBlue}{LMLightBlue}
  \item \textcolor{LMLightBlue75}{LMLightBlue75}
  \item \textcolor{LMLightBlue50}{LMLightBlue50}
  \item \textcolor{LMLightBlue25}{LMLightBlue25}
  \item \textcolor{LMWarmOrange}{LMWarmOrange}
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Requirements}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Requirements}
  This theme makes use of the drawing abilities of the PGF/TikZ packages, so they are required to compile successfully.
\end{frame}

\section{To do}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Things left to do}
  \begin{itemize}
	 \item Fix undefined font warnings
	 \item Use the LM bullet symbol instead of these circles
	 \item Surely many more things\ldots
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Front and back matter}
\frame{
\frametitle{Front matter}
An LM style agenda similar to the PowerPoint template is generated by using the command {\tt \textbackslash Agenda}. \\

Be sure not to use too many sections and subsections so as to not saturate it.
}
\frame{
\frametitle{Back matter}
By using the command {\tt \textbackslash ClosePresentation} the last slide is generated. It contains LM's standard closing slide with the ``Thank you for your time'' frame title and the information about the owner and LM Wind Power, including the non disclosure clause.

The slide owner's information will be generated using the following commands:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt \textbackslash author}
  \item {\tt \textbackslash jobtitle}
  \item {\tt \textbackslash department}
  \item {\tt \textbackslash phone} (optional)
  \item {\tt \textbackslash mobile} (optional)
  \item {\tt \textbackslash email} (optional)
\end{itemize}
}

%This command inserts the ``Thank you for your attention''/Contact information
